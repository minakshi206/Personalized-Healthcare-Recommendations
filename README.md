# 🩺 Healthcare Analytics Dashboard (Machine Learning Project)

An interactive **Healthcare Analytics Dashboard** built using **Streamlit** and **Machine Learning** to analyze blood donor behavior and predict donation likelihood.

This project demonstrates **data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling** in a real-world healthcare-inspired scenario.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The dashboard provides:

✔ Real-time dataset insights  
✔ Donor behavior analysis  
✔ Machine learning predictions  
✔ Clean medical-style UI  

The system uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict whether a donor is likely to donate blood based on historical features.

## 📊 Dataset Features

The model is trained on donor-related attributes:

- **Recency** → Months since last donation  
- **Frequency** → Total number of donations  
- **Monetary** → Total blood donated  
- **Time** → Months since first donation  
- **Class** → Target variable (1 = Likely Donor, 0 = Unlikely Donor)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

Algorithm Used:

**Random Forest Classifier**

Why Random Forest?

✔ Handles non-linear patterns  
✔ Robust & stable performance  
✔ Works well on structured tabular data
